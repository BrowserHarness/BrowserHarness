# BrowserCrew Roadmap

## Foundation
- Organization operating layer
- Browser/control protocol
- Provider-neutral model contracts
- Permission/autonomy model
- Progress-Memory and evaluation baseline

## v0.1 — Ship-fast MVP
Goal: install BrowserCrew, connect an AI provider, give the current tab a task, and reliably observe/act/verify with visible activity and approval gates.

### Required
- Chrome Manifest V3 side panel
- Chat-first UI with progressive disclosure
- Current-tab attachment and context
- Single agent execution loop
- DOM/accessibility observation + screenshot fallback
- Core tools: observe_page, navigate, click, type, press_key, scroll, wait, open_tab, switch_tab, close_tab, screenshot
- OpenAI, Anthropic, NVIDIA and OpenAI-compatible provider connections
- Automatic model discovery for providers exposing compatible `/models` endpoints, with manual fallback
- Single-agent multi-tab operation
- Inline activity, pause/stop and consequential-action approvals
- Local task history
- Basic Watch Me → save workflow → replay
- Material Design UI; Poppins headings, Inter body/UI
- Release evaluation scenarios and Chrome Web Store packaging baseline
